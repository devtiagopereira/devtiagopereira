- 👋 Hi, I’m Tiago Pereira, from Madeira Island. Former Professional Dancer (and trying to switch career).
- 👀 I’m interested in technology and everything related to it. Hardware and Software stuff. And also Web Development, maybe more front-end but I'm open to learn all I can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html+css+javascript the basic because I'm new to this world of web development in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can learn more about programming, maybe some bootcamp. Something where I can learn more.
